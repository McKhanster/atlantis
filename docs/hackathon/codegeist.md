#### 1\. Set up your dev environment

#### 2\. Brainstorm what project you want to build

Draw inspiration from challenges that you and your team are facing today, and frame them against the prize categories.

**Prize Categories:**

*   Apps for Software Teams - Build apps that help software teams operate like a pit crew by enhancing code reviews, streamlining deployments, and tracking issues, enabling developers to deliver with speed and confidence.
    
*   Apps for Business Teams - Build apps that help business teams stay in sync, move quickly, and make timely decisions. Your app should eliminate friction and provide the clarity needed for marketing, finance, HR, customer success, legal, or sales to stay competitive.
    
*   Apps for Specialized Industries - Create apps designed for specialized industries like healthcare, education, retail, and manufacturing. Consider their unique daily challenges and how your app can provide the precision and reliability of an F1 crew under pressure.
